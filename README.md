## **Introduction and Background of Project**
Employee attrition is the event when an employee leaves an organization for any reason and is not replaced for a long time, or not ever. It often results in a decrease in the size of an organization’s or department’s workforce because positions aren’t refilled when employees leave.
Attrition is an unavoidable factor such as employee resignation for personal or professional reasons. For example, a car factory used to need people to put on wheels and install windshields on the assembly line. But now, machines and robots do those jobs, so they don’t need as many assembly line workers. That is the typical reason for employee attrition.
When attrition crosses a particular threshold, it becomes a cause for concern. That is why, understanding the underlying factors contributing to employee attrition is crucial for organizations seeking to optimize their workforce, reduce operational costs, and implement effective retention strategies in an ever-evolving job landscape.
